<!-- # Face Mask Detection

Detecting face masks using Python, Keras, OpenCV on real video streams. -->

## About Project

In this project, we have developed a deep learning model for face mask detection using Python, Keras, and OpenCV. We developed the face mask detector model for detecting whether person is wearing a mask or not. We have trained the model using Keras with network architecture. Training the model is the first part of this project and testing using webcam using OpenCV is the second part.

## Run Project

First you can download and clone this face mask detection repository. Then you will install all packages using "requirement.txt" file using pip command.
```bash
  pip install -r requirement.txt
```
Then your work is first run train mask detector jupyter file and train your model. After your training model is completed you are able to see a graph chart as well as model accuracy.

## Output
After completing training phase you are able to run your Face Video Detector jupyter notebook file and check it using with mask and without mask.

# Conclusion
<li>The ensemble approach not only helps in achieving high accuracy but also improves detection speed considerably. Furthermore, the application of transfer learning on pretrained models with extensive experimentation over an unbiased dataset resulted in a highly robust and low-cost system. The identity detection of faces, violating the mask norms further, increases the utility of the system for public benefits.</li>
