# Face Mask Detection

Detecting face masks using Python, Keras, OpenCV on real video streams.

## Problem Defination 

We are going to build this project in two parts. In the first part, we will write a python script using Keras to train face mask detector model. In the second part, we test the results in a real-time webcam using OpenCV.
Arduino nano v3, buzzer and LED by using this hardware and kit we will build our project and finding the maximum accuracy whether person has wearing mask and without wearing mask.
In this project, a deep learning-based approach for detecting masks over faces in public places like offices, Malls and other public sectors to curtail the community spread of Coronavirus is presented. The proposed technique efficiently handles occlusions in dense situations by making use of an ensemble at the pre-processing level.

## Introduction

In this project, we have developed a deep learning model for face mask detection using Python, Keras, and OpenCV. We developed the face mask detector model for detecting whether person is wearing a mask or not. We have trained the model using Keras with network architecture. Training the model is the first part of this project and testing using webcam using OpenCV is the second part.
Also, in this project we will use Arduino Nano R3, Buzzer and LED. When person is not wearing mask then it will detect and show the red square box as well as display accuracy and display text message like No Mask around that person face and buzzer will on. When person is wearing mask then it will detect and show the green square box around that person face and display the text message like Mask as well as display accuracy on that square box and start blinking the green LED.

## Run Project

First you can download and clone this face mask detection repository. Then you will install all packages using requirement.txt. Then your work is first run train mask detector jupyter file and train your model. After your training model is completed you are able to see a graph chart like this.
